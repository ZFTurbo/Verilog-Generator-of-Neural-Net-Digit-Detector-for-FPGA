# Verilog Generator of Neural Net Digit Detector for FPGA

It's the project which train neural net to detect dark digits on light background. Then neural net converted to
verilog HDL representation using several techniques to reduce needed resources on FPGA and increase speed of processing. Code is
production ready to use in real device. It can be easily extended to be used with detection of other objects with
different neural net structure.

## Requirements
Python 3.5, Tensorflow 1.4.0, Keras 2.1.3

## How to run:
* python r01_train_neural_net_and_prepare_initial_weights.py
* python r02_rescale_weights_to_use_fixed_point_representation.py
* python r03_find_optimal_bit_for_weights.py
* python r04_verilog_generator_grayscale_file.py
* python r05_verilog_generator_neural_net_structure.py

Verilog already added in repository in ''verilog'' folder. It has everything you need including all code
to interact with camera or screen. Neural net verilog description is located in ''verliog/code/neuroset'' folder.

## Device
To recreate the device you need 3 components:
* [De0Nano board](http://www.ti.com/lit/ug/tidu737/tidu737.pdf) (~80$)
* [Camera OV7670](https://www.voti.nl/docs/OV7670.pdf) (~7$)
* [Display ILI9341](https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/datasheets/ILI9341.pdf) (~7$)

### Connection of components

* You need to connect pins with same name
* 'x' pins are not used
* You can see our connection variant on photo below

## Notes

* You can change constant _num_conv = 2_ in r05_verilog_generator_neural_net_structure.py to 1, 2 or 4 convolutional 
blocks which will work in parallel. More blocks will require more LE in FPGA, but increase the overall speed.
